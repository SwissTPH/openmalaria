This directory contains XSD schema files describing scenario files.

The latest schema is composed of the unversion files (scenario.xsd,
demography.xsd, etc.). The schema is compiled into a single file every time
OpenMalaria is built: build/schema/scenario_current.xsd, since a single file is
easier to use when handling validations.

Update policy:
*   update scenario.xsd and C++ code
*   update the schema translator (../util/SchemaTranslator) with a function translating the last release version to the next (translateXToY where X is current version, Y=X+1), doing necessary translations and writing a comment explaining the change
*   update test scenarios when necessary (at least those run by ctest)
*   within inputData.cpp, update SCHEMA_VERSION to the next version number (otherwise it'll refuse to run updated scenarios)

Release policy (new schema versions):
*   copy build/schema/scenario_current.xsd to scenario_VER.xsd
*   update the CURRENT_VERSION var in the schema translator
*   run all scenarios in ../test dir through the schema translator (those already updated by hand should have had their version numbers updated already, so the schema translator doesn't try updating them again)
