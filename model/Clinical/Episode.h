 * An "event" is an instantaeneous alteration of state.
 * A "bout" is a single fever or other sickness (falling sick to recovery).
 * An "episode" is a clinical-view of sickness caused by a malaria infection.
 * There's no reason an "episode" can't span multiple infections and multiple
 * bouts of sickness and recovery (the most severe is reported). */
