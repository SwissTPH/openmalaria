/** Per-species part for vector transmission model.
 *
 * Data in this class is specific to a species of anopheles mosquito, where
 * species is used in a relaxed way to mean any variation of anopheles
 * mosquito, not just those types formally recognised as distinct species.
 *
 * A list of this class type is used by the VectorModel class to hold
 * (potentially) species-specific per-population data.
 *
 * Instead of storing static variables in this class, store them in the
 * VectorModel class.
 *
 * Variable names largely come from Nakul Chitnis's paper:
 * "A mathematical model for the dynamics of malaria in mosquitoes feeding on
 * a heterogeneous host population" (3rd Oct. 2007).
 * 
 * Some terminology extensions (not in paper):
 * 
 * $\nu_A$ / ν_A / leaveRate = sum_i=1^n α_i N_i + μ_vA
 * $\alpha_d$ / α_d / availDivisor = P_Ai / (α_i N_i) = (1 - P_A) / ν_A
 * $\sigma_{df}$ / σ_f / sigma_f = sum_i α_i N_i P_Bi
 * $\sigma_{df}$ / σ_df / sigma_df = sum_i α_i N_i P_Bi P_Ci P_Di
 * $\sigma_{dif}$ / σ_dif / sigma_dif = sum_i α_i N_i P_Bi P_Ci P_Di K_vi
 * 
 * Thus:
 * 
 * P_df = σ_df α_d P_E
 * P_dif = σ_dif α_d P_E
