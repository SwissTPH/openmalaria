    /** @brief StreamValidator implementation.
     *
     * Aim: help tracking down difficult checkpointing problems.
     * 
     * Usage:
     * 
     * 1. Enable cmake option OM_STREAM_VALIDATOR and compile.
     * 
     * 2. Run scenario as normal without checkpointing to generate a reference
     * trace (output to a file called "StreamValidator" in working directory).
     * 
     * 3. Run scenario with checkpointing and the "--stream-validator" option,
     * optionally through a debugger. For example, from the build directory:
     * "test/run.py Empirical --gdb -- --stream-validator ../build/test/Empirical-6_Fsvp/StreamValidator --checkpoint"
     * 
     * 4. Run in debugger (step 3 should have loaded the debugger).
     * In theory, the first section before checkpointing will be in-sync, while
     * the second section after loading a checkpoint should run out of sync.
     * We want to catch where it runs out of sync; to do this, we add a break
     * point at the line mentioned in StreamValidator.cpp:
     * "break StreamValidator.cpp:117". Now run the program until it hits this
     * break-point (probably twice), then get a stack trace ("bt"). The desync
     * occurred somewhere between here and the previous call to streamValidate()
     * in the code. If the debugger never reaches the "out of sync" message in
     * StreamValidator.cpp however, it isn't noticing any desyncronizations.
     * 
     * If this doesn't accurately enough show where the desync occurs, add some
     * extra calls to the "streamValidate()" macro in strategic code locations
     * and repeat steps 2-4.
