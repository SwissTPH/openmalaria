    /* We want K ≥ 0 where K is the killing factor:
    K=BF+HF×h+PF×p+IF×h×p, with h and p defined as:
    h=exp(-holeIndex×holeScalingFactor),
    p=1−exp(-insecticideContent×insecticideScalingFactor). 
    
    By their nature, holeIndex ≥ 0 and insecticideContent ≥ 0. We restrict:
        holeScalingFactor ≥ 0
        insecticideScalingFactor ≥ 0
    Which implies both h and p lie in the range [0,1]. We also know 0 ≤ BF ≤ 1.
    
    We need K ≥ 0 or:
        BF + HF×h + PF×p + IF×h×p ≥ 0   (1)
    
    Lets derive some limits on HF, PF and IF such that the above inequality (1)
    is satisfied.
    
    A net can theoretically be unholed (holeIndex=0 ⇒ h=1) and have no
    insecticide (thus have p=0). Substituting these values in (1) yields:
        BF + HF ≥ 0     (2)
    
    The maximum value for p depends on the maximum insecticide content; denote
    pmax = max(p). Note that holeIndex has no finite maximum; thus, although
    for any finite value of holeIndex, h > 0, there is no h₀ > 0 s.t. for all
    values of holeIndex h ≥ h₀. For the limiting case of a tattered but
    insecticide-saturated net our parameters are therefore p=pmax, h=0:
        BF + PF×pmax ≥ 0        (3)
    
    Consider a net saturated with insecticide (p=pmax) and without holes (h=1):
        BF + HF + (PF+IF)×pmax ≥ 0      (4)
    
    The opposite extreme (the limiting case of a decayed net with no remaining
    insecticide and a large number of holes) yields only BF ≥ 0.
    
    Some of the above examples of nets may be unlikely, but there is only one
    restriction in our model making any of these cases impossible: some
    insecticide must have been lost by the time any holes occur. We ignore this
    since its effect is likely small, and thus all of the above are required to
    keep the factor in the range [0,1]. Further, the inequalities (2) - (3) are
    sufficient to keep the factor within [0,1] since h and p are non-negative
    and act linearly in (1).
    
    From the definition of p, we always have pmax ≤ 1, so substituting pmax=1
    in (5) - (8) gives us bounds which imply our requirement, however if pmax
    is finite they are stricter than necessary. Since insecticideScalingFactor
    is constant, max(p) coincides with max(insecticideContent) which, since
    insecticide content only decays over time, coincides with the maximum
    initial insecticide content, Pmax. Since the initial insecticide content is
    sampled from a normal distribution in our model it should have no finite
    maximum, thus implying we cannot achieve more relaxed bounds than (5) - (8)
    when pmax=1 (unless the standard deviation of our normal distribution is 1).
    We would however like to impose less strict bounds than these, thus we
    impose a maximum value on the initial insecticide content, Pmax, such that
    the probability of sampling a value from our parameterise normal
    distribution greater than Pmax is 0.001. */

    p=1−exp(-insecticideContent×insecticideScalingFactor). 
    
    By their nature, holeIndex ≥ 0 and insecticideContent ≥ 0. We restrict:
        holeScalingFactor ≥ 0
        insecticideScalingFactor ≥ 0
    Which implies both h and p lie in the range [0,1]. We also know the base
    survival factor, 1−BF, is in the range [0,1].
    
    To make sure the survival factor is not negative we need (1−K)/(1−BF) ≥ 0.
    Since 1−BF > 0 we need 1−K ≥ 0, which, substituting K, gives us
        BF + HF×h + PF×p + IF×h×p ≤ 1	(1)
    We also want to make sure the survival factor is not greater than one (since
    nets shouldn't increase mosquito survival), (1−K)/(1−BF) ≤ 1 or equivalently
    1-K ≤ 1-BF or K ≥ BF, which, substituting K, yields
        HF×h + PF×p + IF×h×p ≥ 0		(2)
    
    Lets derive some limits on HF, PF and IF such that the above inequalities
    (1) and (2) are satisfied.
    
    A net can theoretically be unholed (holeIndex=0 ⇒ h=1) and have no
    insecticide (thus have p=0). Substituting these values in (1) and (2) yields:
        BF + HF ≤ 1	(3)
        HF ≥ 0		(4)
    
    The maximum value for p depends on the maximum insecticide content; denote
    pmax = max(p). Note that holeIndex has no finite maximum; thus, although
    for any finite value of holeIndex, h > 0, there is no h₀ > 0 s.t. for all
    values of holeIndex h ≥ h₀. For the limiting case of a tattered but
    insecticide-saturated net our parameters are therefore p=pmax, h=0:
        BF + PF×pmax ≤ 1	(5)
        PF×pmax ≥ 0			(6)
    (Assuming pmax > 0, (6) is equivalent to PF ≥ 0.)
    
    Consider a net saturated with insecticide (p=pmax) and without holes (h=1):
        BF + HF + (PF+IF)×pmax ≤ 1	(7)
        HF + (PF+IF)×pmax ≥ 0		(8)
    
    The opposite extreme (the limiting case of a decayed net with no remaining
    insecticide and a large number of holes) yields only BF ≤ 1 which we already
    know.
    
    Some of the above examples of nets may be unlikely, but there is only one
    restriction in our model making any of these cases impossible: some
    insecticide must have been lost by the time any holes occur. We ignore this
    since its effect is likely small, and thus all of the above are required to
    keep the survival factor in the range [0,1]. Further, these six inequalities
    (3) - (8) are sufficient to keep the survival factor within [0,1] since h
    and p are non-negative and act linearly in (1) and (2).
    
    From the definition of p, we always have pmax ≤ 1, so substituting pmax=1
    in (5) - (8) gives us bounds which imply our requirement, however if pmax
    is finite they are stricter than necessary. Since insecticideScalingFactor
    is constant, max(p) coincides with max(insecticideContent) which, since
    insecticide content only decays over time, coincides with the maximum
    initial insecticide content, Pmax. Since the initial insecticide content is
    sampled from a normal distribution in our model it should have no finite
    maximum, thus implying we cannot achieve more relaxed bounds than (5) - (8)
    when pmax=1 (unless the standard deviation of our normal distribution is 1).
    We would however like to impose less strict bounds than these, thus we
    impose a maximum value on the initial insecticide content, Pmax, such that
    the probability of sampling a value from our parameterise normal
